## Introduction 

This project develops an intelligent configurator, including a BIM library offering collaborative BIM data accessibility, 
a similarity analysis between traditional projects and standardized products, 
and a generative design to optimize project configurations with modern methods of construction.
In this repository we will store the sourcecode, test and efforts towards the development of the tool
